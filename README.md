<h3>Student Performance Predictor üéì</h3>
Project Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project designed to predict student academic performance‚Äîsuch as exam scores outcomes‚Äîbased on features like study hours,etc.
Motivation

Academic institutions and educators can use predictive insights to proactively identify students at risk of underperforming and offer timely support‚Äîenhancing educational outcomes and equity.
Key Features

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing datasets to understand underlying patterns.

    Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and scaling features.

    Feature Engineering & Selection: Identifying the most relevant predictors & improving model performance.

    Model Training: Implementing and comparing various machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, SVM, CatBoost, etc.

Installation

    Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yashtiwarii0/Student_Performance_Predictor.git  
cd Student_Performance_Predictor

Set up a virtual environment

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage Instructions
A) Interactive Mode using Notebooks

    Launch Jupyter and run EDA and modeling notebooks (e.g., EDA.ipynb, Model_Training.ipynb).

B) Command-Line / Script-based Workflow

    Prepare your dataset (e.g., student-data.csv)

    Run ingestion & preprocessing

python src/data_ingestion.py
python src/data_preprocessing.py

Train your model

    python src/model_training.py

    Save the model to model/ or appropriate location.

C) Web App Prediction (Flask / Streamlit)

    Run the web server

    python src/predict_app.py

    Access in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict and input student information to get predictions.
